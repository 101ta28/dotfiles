## Instruction

Think in English and respond to the user in Japanese.

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in ~/.codex/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

## GitHub Search Tips
- When you find a file on GitHub, replace `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/<path>` with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/refs/heads/<branch>/<path>` to view the raw file directly.
- Example: `https://github.com/101ta28/101ta28-Repo/blob/main/main.py` → `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/101ta28/101ta28-Repo/refs/heads/main/main.py`
